# Objectives

1. To analyse the current sampling technique CCSP in FRA.
2. To test different CCSP alternatives and suggest the most accurate one.
3. Effect of density distribution and diameter class distribution in CCSP method.
4. To examine the possibility of best circular sample plot size for National and Subnational Inventory.


# Research Questions

1. Does currently applied Concentric Circular Sample Plot (CCSP) estimates accurate per ha data.
2. Do the density distribution and diameter sizes of the trees has significant effect on the validity of CCSP.
3. Can we shift to one circular sample plot method to simplify the sampling design.
4. If yes, what could be the best sample plot size to justify national and subnational forest inventory.
